**Status**: ⚠️ ERROR

**Execution Time**: 63.36 seconds

**Steps**:
1. Navigate to the quick quote page.
2. Accept cookies.
3. Select a valid country.
4. Leave one or more required contact information fields blank (e.g., Email).

Attempted to proceed by clicking the 'Next' button, but the button was not interactive or did not have a clickable index, preventing submission attempt.

**Notes**:
Could not complete the test case as designed because the 'Next' button was not interactable after filling in other fields and leaving email blank. Therefore, could not verify if validation errors appear as expected.

**Execution Time**: 40.52 seconds
