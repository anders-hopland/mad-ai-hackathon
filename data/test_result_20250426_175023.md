### TC005: Attempt to add a very large quantity of a product.

**Status**: ❌ FAIL

**Execution Time**: 90.42 seconds

1. Navigate to a product category page.
2. Locate a product.

**Actual Result**:
Navigated to the 'Frukt og grønt' category, added 'Mangoterninger' to the cart, and successfully increased the quantity to 10 by clicking the '+' button repeatedly. Attempted to input '999' into the quantity field, but the page state changed unexpectedly, and the product's quantity controls were no longer identifiable by the previous index. Subsequent attempts to scroll and locate the product and its quantity input failed. The test could not be completed as the quantity input field for a large quantity could not be located after the initial attempt to add a large quantity.

**Notes**:
The page structure changed after adding the item and clicking '+', causing the previously identified input field index to become invalid. Repeated scrolling did not bring the product back into the visible area.

Navigated to product detail page, clicked 'Legg til i handlekurven'. The UI updated to show 'Fjern fra handlekurven' and the quantity input with value '2', indicating the product was added to the basket.

**Notes**:
Initial attempt to click the button used the wrong index, but the subsequent click with the correct index was successful and the UI updated as expected.
